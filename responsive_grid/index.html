				<h1>Cannoli Cafe Incident -  A reflection of our colonial influenced mindset</h1>
				<p>A video that took the social media by storm a few days back featured two women who owned Cannoli by Soul Cafe were found mocking their manager for not being well versed in English. They received a massive backlash for their shameful conduct. Enraged and disgusted, people from all walks of life be it actors, singers, or other public figures came out and strongly condemned this pathetic act along with boycotting the cafe. Even an Urdu mushaira was arranged outside the cafe to teach these pretentious snobs a lesson. Though such a strong condemnable reaction against the owners propelled them to apologize, thereâ€™s still a lot more to it than just that.
